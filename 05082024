The image shows a microservice architecture diagram, illustrating the flow of data and interactions between various components. Here's a brief description of each part:

1. **Database**:
   - **NR, DR, PR**: These likely represent different types of databases or database tables (possibly for various environments like Non-Relational, Development, and Production).
   - **DB**: The main database where data is stored.

2. **Business Logic Processing Layer**:
   - **JVM/COBOL**: This indicates that the business logic is handled using a combination of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and COBOL. COBOL programs are executed within the JVM.
   - **Logs**: This component is responsible for logging activities within the business logic layer.

3. **Integration Layer**:
   - **Java/Spring**: This part handles integration and is built using Java and the Spring framework, indicating the use of Spring Boot for microservices.

4. **API Gateway**:
   - Acts as an entry point for clients (channels) to interact with the microservices. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices and handles concerns like security, load balancing, and rate limiting.

5. **Channels**:
   - Represents various user interfaces or systems that interact with the microservices through the API Gateway.

6. **Banklink/NBC**:
   - This component likely represents an external banking system or service that the microservice architecture interacts with.

Overall, the diagram outlines a microservice-based approach to handling business logic and data processing, utilizing a mix of legacy and modern technologies (COBOL and Java/Spring) and ensuring smooth integration through an API Gateway.
