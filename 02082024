### Scope for Architecture of Core Banking System Merged with Microservices

#### 1. **Overview**
The architecture of a core banking system merged with microservices focuses on leveraging the modular, scalable, and flexible nature of microservices to enhance the functionalities of a traditional core banking system. The goal is to break down the monolithic architecture of core banking into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

#### 2. **Core Components**

1. **Customer Management Service**:
   - Handles customer onboarding, profile management, KYC (Know Your Customer) processes.
   - Manages customer data and provides APIs for other services to access customer information.

2. **Account Management Service**:
   - Manages various types of accounts (savings, checking, loans).
   - Provides APIs for account creation, balance inquiries, and transaction history.

3. **Transaction Management Service**:
   - Processes and records financial transactions.
   - Ensures real-time transaction processing and integrates with payment gateways and other financial systems.

4. **Loan Management Service**:
   - Handles loan applications, approvals, disbursements, and repayments.
   - Provides APIs for loan products and customer loan information.

5. **Payment Processing Service**:
   - Manages payment processing for various channels (online banking, mobile banking, ATMs).
   - Integrates with external payment networks and services.

6. **Notification Service**:
   - Sends alerts and notifications to customers via email, SMS, and push notifications.
   - Manages communication preferences and history.

7. **Reporting and Analytics Service**:
   - Generates reports for regulatory compliance, audit, and business insights.
   - Utilizes data analytics for customer insights and fraud detection.

8. **Security and Authentication Service**:
   - Manages user authentication, authorization, and identity management.
   - Ensures secure access to services and protects against fraud.

#### 3. **Supporting Components**

1. **API Gateway**:
   - Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.
   - Handles request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.

2. **Service Discovery**:
   - Automatically detects and registers microservices.
   - Provides service location and health check information.

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Centralizes configuration management for all microservices.
   - Supports dynamic configuration updates without redeploying services.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Provides real-time monitoring and logging for all microservices.
   - Ensures system health and helps in debugging and troubleshooting.

5. **Database Management**:
   - Manages multiple databases for different services.
   - Ensures data consistency, integrity, and security.

#### 4. **Integration**

1. **Internal Integration**:
   - Microservices communicate with each other using lightweight protocols (HTTP/REST, gRPC).
   - Event-driven architecture using message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication.

2. **External Integration**:
   - Integrates with third-party systems (credit bureaus, payment gateways, regulatory bodies).
   - Uses APIs and secure communication protocols for data exchange.

#### 5. **Benefits**

1. **Scalability**:
   - Each service can be scaled independently based on demand.
   - Improves overall system performance and resource utilization.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Allows for the adoption of new technologies and frameworks.
   - Facilitates faster development and deployment cycles.

3. **Resilience**:
   - Failure in one service does not impact the entire system.
   - Enhanced fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms.

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Smaller codebases are easier to manage and update.
   - Promotes continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

#### 6. **Challenges**

1. **Complexity**:
   - Increased complexity in managing distributed services.
   - Requires robust infrastructure and tooling.

2. **Data Consistency**:
   - Ensuring data consistency across multiple services can be challenging.
   - Requires careful design and implementation of data synchronization mechanisms.

3. **Security**:
   - Each service needs to be secured individually.
   - Ensuring consistent security policies across services.

4. **Inter-Service Communication**:
   - Managing communication and data flow between services.
   - Requires efficient and reliable communication mechanisms.

By merging core banking systems with microservices architecture, banks can achieve a more agile, scalable, and resilient system that meets modern banking needs while maintaining high standards of security and compliance.

## Transaction Flow Overview

The provided diagram illustrates the flow of transactions within the CBS (Core Banking System) architecture. It showcases the path a transaction takes from the input stage in JSON format through various layers until the final output, also in JSON format.

### Flow Breakdown

1. **Input in JSON Format**: 
   - The transaction data is initially provided in JSON format, making it easy to parse and manipulate.

2. **Java Layer**:
   - The input JSON is processed by the Java layer, where initial validations and transformations are performed as needed.

3. **JVM Layer**:
   - After the Java layer, the data passes through the JVM layer, which handles the execution of Java bytecode and manages resources.

4. **CBS**:
   - The CBS layer is where core banking operations are carried out. This could involve various business logic, transaction processing, and integration with other banking services.

5. **Database**:
   - The processed transaction data is then stored in the database, ensuring that all transactions are logged and can be retrieved or analyzed later.

6. **CBS**:
   - Post database operations, the transaction may undergo additional processing or validation within the CBS layer to ensure completeness and accuracy.

7. **JVM Layer**:
   - The data is once again handled by the JVM layer for any necessary final executions or resource management.

8. **Java Layer**:
   - Finally, the Java layer formats the processed transaction data into the output JSON format.

9. **Output in JSON Format**:
   - The completed transaction data is outputted in JSON format, making it easy to consume by other systems or services.

### Benefits of the Transaction Flow

- **Tracking and Debugging**:
  - The architecture allows for detailed tracking of transaction flow, making it easier to identify and debug issues at any stage of the process.
  
- **Code Flow Identification**:
  - By printing the names of the parameters involved in each code segment, developers can easily identify the structure and flow of the code. This is particularly useful in complex systems with multiple components and end-of-day (EOD) processing.

- **Real-Time Transaction Monitoring**:
  - The structured flow helps in real-time monitoring of transactions, ensuring that any issues can be promptly identified and addressed.

- **Enhanced Transparency**:
  - With clear delineation of each layer and the operations performed, stakeholders can have a better understanding of the system's inner workings and the journey of each transaction.
