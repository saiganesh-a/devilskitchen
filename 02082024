### Flowchart Redesign and Explanation

Below is a redesigned flowchart with detailed explanations for each step, along with an explanation of what JSON is and why it is used in this project.

#### **Flowchart Explanation:**

1. **JSON Input:**
   - **What It Is:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
   - **Why It Is Used:** JSON is used in this project to transfer data between the client and the server in a structured way. It is widely supported by various programming languages and is the preferred format for web services due to its simplicity and flexibility.

2. **TCSBANCS SERVICES:**
   - **What It Is:** This represents a service layer in the application, likely part of a larger banking system (TCS Bancs). The services here are responsible for handling business logic and interactions with other system components.
   - **Why It Is Used:** The TCSBANCS services are essential for processing the JSON input and interacting with backend systems or databases to perform the necessary operations, such as fetching or updating data.

3. **Wrapper Class:**
   - **What It Is:** A wrapper class in Java is used to encapsulate multiple objects or data types into a single object. It acts as a bridge between the input (JSON) and the application logic.
   - **Why It Is Used:** The wrapper class is used to simplify and standardize the input data, ensuring it is in a consistent format before processing it further. This also helps in easier data validation and error handling.

4. **Spring Validations:**
   - **What It Is:** Spring Framework provides a validation mechanism that ensures the correctness of the data before further processing. It typically involves checking for null values, data formats, and other constraints.
   - **Why It Is Used:** Validation is crucial to ensure that the data coming from the user or external systems meets the expected format and constraints, preventing errors or security issues later in the process.

   - **End User Impact:** If validation fails, the user will receive an error indicating a problem with the web service, as the data does not meet the expected criteria.

5. **Application Properties Read:**
   - **What It Is:** This step involves reading configuration settings from the `application.properties` file. This file usually contains settings like database connections, API keys, or other configurable parameters.
   - **Why It Is Used:** Reading the application properties ensures that the system is configured correctly before proceeding. This step is vital for enabling flexible and environment-specific configurations.

   - **End User Impact:** If the application properties cannot be read (e.g., due to missing or incorrect settings), the user will receive an error related to fetching data.

6. **Validation of Input:**
   - **What It Is:** This step involves validating the input data after it has passed through the earlier stages. It ensures that the data meets all business rules and is ready for further processing.
   - **Why It Is Used:** Final validation is critical to ensure that the data is complete, accurate, and in a format that the business logic can process without issues.

#### **Flowchart Design:**

- **Shape Usage:**
  - **Rectangles:** Represent processes or steps in the flow.
  - **Diamonds:** Indicate decision points where the process can branch based on conditions.
  - **Arrows:** Show the flow of the process from one step to another.

- **Color Scheme:**
  - **Input Steps:** Use a different color (e.g., light blue) to indicate initial data input.
  - **Processing Steps:** Use a consistent color (e.g., light green) for processing-related steps.
  - **Validation Steps:** Use a color like yellow to indicate validation checks.
  - **Error Handling:** Use red to represent error conditions leading to end-user errors.
